# Pet Adoption Validator

This is a simple web application that validates the syntax of pet adoption codes for the SPCA.

## Requirements

All pet adoption codes should follow the following format:

- Start with "pet_"
- Followed by the pet's birth year (4 digits)
- Followed by the pet's name (letters and numbers)

Example: `pet_2015Forrest`

## Challenge Instructions
1. In the script.js file, complete the validateSyntax function to check if the input string starts with "pet_" and is followed by a combination of letters and numbers.
2. If the input follows the correct syntax, set result to "Valid Syntax." Otherwise, set it to "Invalid Syntax."
3. Test your function by entering different strings in the input box and clicking the validate button.

## How to Test 
- Run the index.html challenge in a browser.
- Enter different pet adoption details in the input box and click the validate button to see the results.
- Make sure your solution works for a variety of inputs.
- Open the console and debug your code until there are no errors.

## Instructions for Running the Code
1. Save the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files in a folder.
2. Open the folder in VSCode.
3. Right-click on index.html and open with a browser (use Live Server if available).
4. Modify the script.js file to correct the syntax errors and save the file.
5. Refresh your browser to view the changes.
